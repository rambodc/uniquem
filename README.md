# Uniquem

Uniquem’s public website and private contact inbox. The site uses Vite/React, Firebase Hosting, Firebase Functions, Firestore, Storage rules, and Firebase Authentication.

## One-time Firebase setup

1. Create `rambodr@uniquem.ca` as an Email/Password user in Firebase Authentication.
2. Mark the user’s email as verified.
3. Enable Email/Password sign-in in Firebase Authentication.
4. Add the repository secrets below to the `Prod` GitHub environment.

## GitHub Actions secrets

- `GCP_WIF_PROVIDER`
- `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
- `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID`

Production deploys happen only from the `production` branch. Hosting, Functions, and Firebase rules are deployed by separate workflows; pull requests run checks only.
